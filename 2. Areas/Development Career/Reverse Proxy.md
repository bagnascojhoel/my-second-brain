# Reverse Proxy
Similar to a coventional Proxy Server, a Reverse Proxy Server acts as a middleware for the incomming requests for your application server(s). With a Proxy Server, the clients make requests directly to it. This can lead to an overload, depending on how many requests it receives. On the otherhand, a Reverse Proxy intercepts requests destined to your application server. Meaning that you can add many Reverse Proxies for parts of your application server pool.
