- **Apply yourself to solve problems, even if you don't know how to solve them.** But make sure to clarify that you have yet to learn things.
- **Talk about what's happening with your task.** Any obstacle you face should be notified to the people who are responsible for you. Do not let problems blow when a deadline is closing in.  
- **Write a blog.** The best moment to explain things is when you are learning them. Writing a blog will improve your linear thinking. It doesn't matter if no one views it or if people comment pejorative things about it. The ability to express yourself linearly is extremely valuable.
- **When stuck, take a break.** If things like "How dumb am I?", "This doesn't make any sense!" start to pop in your head, you need to relax. Those thoughts indicate that you are not trying to solve the problem anymore.
- **Coding is not the best you can do.  Helping your team will be more productive.** When you are knowledgeable, you can be the source of [[Force Multiplication]] for your team. You may be faster to deliver a code, but you are still only one person. If you help your teammates, you'll have many more brains to solve problems.
