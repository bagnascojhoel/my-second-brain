The difference between these design patterns is resides on the type of problem we are solving with each. Even though the implementations are really similar, a "pattern" is something in the realm of problem-solving. Meaning that a pattern solves a problem (or a set o problems) and can be implemented in a variaty of ways.
- **Adapter**: solves non-compatible interfaces.
- **Fa√ßade**: solves unecessarily complex interfaces.
- **Proxy**: solves management of access to an object.
- **Flyweight**: solves heavy usage of memory for duplicated data.
- **Decorator**: solves the need to dinamically add functionality to an object.
