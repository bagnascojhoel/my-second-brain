## Content Delivery Network
Temporary replication of data on locations, ideally, far from the server. Let's say your server is on Japan, and you want people from all around the world to access it without much delay. A CDN can see incoming requests from USA, generate the code the client will should receive, and then store it in a server on USA. So whenever someone near USA wants to access your content, they can simply use the USA copy and avoid all latency
