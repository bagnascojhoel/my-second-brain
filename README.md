# Second Brain

This is my personal public [Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/). I use it to take notes of everything I deem relevant and not important enough that it should be kept private. While reading about the concept of a Second Brain, I crossed paths with the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) and choose to organize my files with it. At this moment, I still did not have any urge to change out of it.

The application that I use to manage these files is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Actually, I first came to know of this amazing application for [its hot graph view](https://obsidian.md/images/screenshot.png) and then came to the idea of having a Second Brain. I was kind of making one already (as I think everyone does with their notes), but chose to use markdown, organize it with PARA and make it public on GitHub thanks to Obsidian.
